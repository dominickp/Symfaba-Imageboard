# Symfaba Imageboard

This is a Symfony-based imageboard, modelled after Futaba style imageboards such as Futallaby, Wakaba, and Kusaba X. There is a basic user registration system but these style of imageboards allow users to post anonymously, so I have allowed thread and reply creation without the need for making an account.

### Todo
- Basic mod panel to remove posts/threads
- Pagination for thread browsing
- Catalog mode
- Add some more javascript to better fulfill the project requirements


### Bugs
- Can submit a reply with no message AND no image
